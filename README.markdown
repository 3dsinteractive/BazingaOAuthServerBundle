    /!\ This bundle is not yet perfectly unit tested (well, in fact it's not unit tested except for signatures...)
    You should not use it but you can provide tests or ideas. I'll do my best to provide strong unit tests.

    OH, one more thing: I don't manage nonce/timestamp yet.

    WTF ?!! Why did I release that ? Just to prove there is not only a README and it's more convenient for me to work with Github.


BazingaOAuthServerBundle
========================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/willdurand/BazingaOAuthServerBundle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/willdurand/BazingaOAuthServerBundle)

This bundle provides all you need to manage OAuth in a server side way.

This bundle implements the **OAuth v1.0** protocol based on the **RFC 5849**.

**NOTE: for now, there is no implementation of the Model. You have to implement all interfaces in
the `Model/` folder and the logic behind.**
