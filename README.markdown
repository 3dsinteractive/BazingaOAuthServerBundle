    /!\ This bundle is not yet perfectly unit tested (well, in fact it's not unit tested except for signatures...)
    You should not use it but you can provide tests or ideas. I'll do my best to provide strong unit tests.


BazingaOAuthServerBundle
========================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/willdurand/BazingaOAuthServerBundle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/willdurand/BazingaOAuthServerBundle)

This bundle provides all you need to manage OAuth in a server side way.

This bundle implements the **OAuth v1.0** protocol based on the **RFC 5849**.

**NOTE: for now, there is no implementation of the Model. You have to implement all interfaces in
the `Model/` folder and the logic behind.**
